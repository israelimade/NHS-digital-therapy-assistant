# NHS Digital Therapy Assistant

## Overview
This repository outlines the concept and proposed technical architecture for an AI-powered NHS Digital Therapy Assistant.  
The goal is to provide initial occupational therapy self-assessment and guidance for patients, helping to prioritise care and reduce waiting times.

## Features
- Conversational AI interface for guided self-assessment
- Clinically validated question sets for accurate triage
- Integration with NHS booking and referral systems
- Multi-platform access: web, mobile, and voice assistants
- Privacy-first design with on-device or secure NHS-hosted deployment

## Problem
NHS occupational therapy services face long waiting lists and limited resources. Patients often have no structured way to assess needs while waiting, leading to delays in critical care.

## Proposed Solution
- Fine-tuned open-source large language model (LLM) based on NHS-approved frameworks
- Patient-friendly conversational interface
- Real-time triage recommendations and resource links
- Accessibility features for diverse patient needs

## Impact
- Shorter referral-to-assessment times
- Better prioritisation of urgent cases
- More consistent and equitable triage
- Empowered patients with self-management tools
